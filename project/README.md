# Image Manipulation Tests

A repo to test out image manipulation packages in python

##Â tip

in vscode terminal, set up an alias to the main script you run often, for faster testing.

`alias aa='python3 project/main.py'`

Then when you run `aa` it will run the script much faster when testing new functions out.
